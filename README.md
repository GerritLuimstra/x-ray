# Kaggle X-ray project

This is my implementation for the pneumonia prediction challenge on the X-ray dataset hosted on Kaggle [1].

To run this project, first install the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.
If preferred, create a virtual environment first before installing these packages (recommended).
After this is done, you can go into the src/ folder and run execute the IPython notebook (```train.ipynb```).

The experiments were conducted using Python 3.10 and 3.9.7.

NOTE: Depending on the version of Python, a different version of Pytorch might be required.
